# Music-subscription
Second assignment for Cloud Computing Semester 1 2021

Link to app : http://ec2-52-205-1-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com/ (provided EC2 instance is still running).

An online music subscription app built with Python Flask, Amazon s3 and DynamoDB and hosted on a free-tier EC2 instance (with Ubuntu Server 20.04/18.04 LTS AMI).

## What I learned
1. How to store, query and configure AWS DynamoDB.
2. How to use s3 for object storage.
3. How to deploy apps on AWS EC2 instance and configure instance with Apache2 for web apps.
